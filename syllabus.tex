\section*{Mission Statement}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Mission Statement}

The goal of this document is to provide a clear vision of Math 103 that can be utilized by both instructors and students to gain a perspective on what will be covered during a term. Throughout, learning goals are presented to help make it clear what instructors should teach and what knowledge students should expect to obtain upon successful completion of the course. 

\vskip1em

The Math 102 and 103 sequence is very different from its two sister first year calculus sequences offered at UBC. This sequence focuses heavily on biological applications and emphasizes understanding how these ideas play a role in real world situations. As such, many proofs are deemphasized if not altogether omitted (the main exception being the content on series).

\vskip1em

The document also makes extensive references to the Math Educational Resources wiki. This project began in 2012 out of a desire to create a free working resource for undergraduates. Graduate students volunteer their time towards the development of this project. The site can be found at 

\begin{center}
\url{http://wiki.ubc.ca/Science:Math_Educational_Resources}
\end{center}

 Here, students can find relevant exam questions \textbf{by exam} or \textbf{by topic}. Videos are also embedded on topic links to help reinforce concepts and aid in reminding students of the core ideas. The original author of this document, Carmen Bruni, included pencasts on the wiki which were created specifically for this course. Combining this with many of the examples present in this document makes this not only a syllabus, but an extremely valuable resource for students to ensure that they are learning the correct material in order to excel in this course.

\vskip1em

Solutions when provided are presented only in a minimalist form. Students working through the problems are encouraged to write out complete comprehensive solutions. These solutions are only present as a time saving measure for students. Students are more than welcomed and even encouraged to discuss questions found in this document with their instructors or fellow peers. Concerns or confusions found on the wiki should be discussed on the wiki itself.

\vskip1em

Any comments about this current version are welcomed and can be sent to Carmen Bruni at cbruni@alumni.ubc.ca. The TeX file is also available upon request.

\section*{Prerequisites}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Prerequisites}

The following is a base set of skills one needs in order to do well in this course. Any problems in these areas should seek immediate rectification.

\begin{itemize}
\item Adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing rational functions (that is, functions where the numerator and denominator are both polynomials and the denominator is nonzero).
\item Solving for roots of quadratic polynomials using all of the following methods: factoring, completing the square, and the quadratic formula. This also includes finding common factors in expressions
\item Solving systems of equations
\item Manipulate exponents including but not limited to $x^{a}x^{b} = x^{a+b}$, $(x^{a})^{b} = x^{ab}$, $\frac{x^{a}}{x^{b}} = x^{a-b}$, $y=e^{x} \Leftrightarrow \ln(y) = x$.
\item Derivatives and graphs of elementary functions including $x^{a}$ where $a$ is a real number, trigonometric, inverse trigonometric, logarithmic and exponential functions.
\item All rules of differentiation (power, product, quotient, chain rules).
\item Understanding and being able to compute limits of functions.
\item Basic familiarity with differential equations (what are they, how they are used).
\item A working understanding of trigonometry, including but not limited to drawing the function of $\sin(x)$,$\cos(x)$,$\tan(x)$ and values of these functions at $0$,$\pi/6$,$\pi/4$,$\pi/3$,$\pi/2$ and these values added with multiples of $\pi /2$.
\end{itemize}


Solutions are included here to help with solving problems. These are in general \textit{not intended to be full solutions} but are included to help you verify that your work is correct. 
\vskip1em
Learning goal sections roughly correspond to weeks of the course which also roughly correspond to chapters in the course notes.
\vskip1em
Throughout this article, an implicit emphasis will be to apply many of these learning goals in a variety of biological applications not explicitly given in the exercises. These will be a mix of WebWork problems as well as examples covered in class. The best way to practice is to attempt problems and make sure you're familiar with examples covered in the notes (even if your instructor does not cover them in class).

\section{Summary}

Knowledge (Total : \arabic{Kcount}). These types of question refer to rote memorization of information and the ability to repeat the information exactly.
\vskip1em
Comprehension (Total : \arabic{Ccount}). This involves the ability to demonstrate an understanding of key facts of gained knowledge.
\vskip1em
Application (Total : \arabic{Apcount}). This involves taking the knowledge points and actually using the information to solve concrete problems.
\vskip1em
Analysis (Total : \arabic{Ancount}). This involves breaking down complex parts into simple components and applying skills learnt to each part.
\vskip1em
Evaluation (Total : \arabic{Ecount}). This involves making judgements or offering explanations on certain content.
\vskip1em
Proof (Total : \arabic{Pcount}). This could have been grouped with evaluation above but warrants a bit of extra emphasis. In problems with this flag, the process is far more valuable than the direct answer to a problem. With these problem, there is more of a focus on understand how parts fits together and being able to explain your answer with proper justification to another person.
